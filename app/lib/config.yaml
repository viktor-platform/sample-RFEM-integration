# CONFIGURATION FILE FOR VIKTOR WORKER TO RUN GENERIC EXECUTABLE / SCRIPT
#
# > Required keys: executables (dictionary with name of executable as key containing key-value pairs for path, arguments and working directory) and maxParallelProcesses
# > The key of executable is used to distinguish between different jobs that can be transferred to the worker
# > Use either double quotes: "example", or single quotes: 'example' 
# > Double quotes require special characters to be escaped, whereas single quotes can be used for raw strings
# > Trailing slashes are not required in paths
# > If you do not want to call an executable set executables to: {}
# > If the executable does not take any additional arguments specify arguments as an empty sequence: []
#
# Replace the path to where create_model.bat is located, can be any location with the right permissions
